# Golang_server

**Web Server Project in Go (Golang)**
                                
                                This project involves creating a simple but efficient web server using Go, a statically typed, compiled programming
                                language known for its performance and simplicity. The project demonstrates how to set up a basic web server, handle 
                                HTTP requests, and serve dynamic content or static files.

**Project Overview**              
                    
                    The main goal of the project is to create a lightweight HTTP server
                    that can serve both static files (like HTML, CSS, JS, images)

**Key Features:**

Simple HTTP Server :
                  
                    Uses Goâ€™s built-in net/http package to handle HTTP requests.
                    Listens on a specific port and serves web content.

Static File Serving:
                    
                    Serves static assets such as HTML files, CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, and image files.
                    Can specify a directory from which static content is served.

Error Handling:
               
               Implements basic error handling for things like invalid routes or server errors.
               Returns appropriate HTTP status codes like 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error, and 400 Bad Request.

**Learning Outcomes:**
                  
                  Gain an understanding of how to build web servers using Go.
                  Learn how to handle HTTP requests, define routes, and serve static and dynamic content.
                  Understand concurrency handling in Go to manage multiple requests efficiently.
                  Learn about basic error handling, middleware, and web server best practices.
                  This project can be extended to more complex use cases such as building an API with full
                  CRUD operations, user authentication, or integrating with front-end frameworks
                  like React or Vue.js for a complete web application.
